# Boosting Zero-shot Human-Object Interaction Detection with Vision-Language Transfer (ICASSP 2024)

Official code for the ICASSP 2024 paper that implements a one-stage DETR-based network for zero-shot HOI detection boosted with vision-language transfer. To be updated soon.


## Pre-trained models
- Download the params folder and put it outside all folders for DETR-based pretrained models.
- Outside all folders, make a new folder called ```ckpt``` and download the pretrained model of CLIP for [CLIP50x16](https://openaipublic.azureedge.net/clip/models/52378b407f34354e150460fe41077663dd5b39c54cd0bfd2b27167a4a06ec9aa/RN50x16.pt) inside it.
